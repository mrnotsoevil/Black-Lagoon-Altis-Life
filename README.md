Altis Life RPG
Version 3.1.2
By Tonic
========================================

Because Tonic prohibits renaming his mod, it's still called "Altis Life RPG", BUT it SHOULD be called "Black Lagoon Altis Life RPG" :( 
Not everybody is evil, Tonic!

4. Notes

We are a german server, so everything is translated into german; but the code/script style is engish!
The 'homes' table is pulled from our active running server, so you have to run following command, after importing the sql file:

    UPDATE homes SET owner=' ', owned='0', inventory='"[]"', inventory_weight='100', trustedpersons='"[]"', ownername=' '

Disable safety features if necessary!


!!! Check that there's only ONE pbo file per folder! They will load BOTH and WILL create errors! !!!


--- DYNPERMS ---

DynPerms is an extension to Perms (Group Manager), allowing to add dynamically created groups by using the database (Normal perms are in the script).

Schema:

    permid:		Id of the perm (eg. 'user_bloodz')
    permname:		Human readable name of the perm (eg. 'The BloodZ')
    maxrank:		Maximal rank (eg. '7')
    ruleconfig:		Configuration of rules by rank (see permconfiguration.sqf for schema) (eg. '"[[0,[]],[1,["VIEW"]],[2,["VIEW"]],[3,["VIEW"]],[4,["VIEW"]],[5,["VIEW"]],[6,["LEADER","RANKUP","RANKDOWN","VIEW"]],[7,["LEADER","RANKUP","RANKDOWN","VIEW"]]]"')
    member_conditions:	See permconfiguration.sqf
    logo:		eg. 'images\logo_user\bloodz.paa'
    levelnames:		Name for EACH LEVEL (including ZERO!!!) eg. '"["Kein Mitglied","Blood-Praktikant","Blood-Grünschnabel","Blood-Dealer","Blood-Hitman","Blood-Rechte Hand","Blood-CoLeader","Blood-Leader"]"'
    
    
If the server sends you ">PERMS< Unknown perms found ... looking for DYNPERMS":
This is NOT an error message. It's just the DynPerms database refresh.

--- Perms/'Group' feature for cops ---

You HAVE to set coplevel to 0 if you want to set coplevel by PERMS, because the database will ALWAYS override PERMS, because it's more secure.
    
--- GUIs Folder ---

This folder is NOT important for the server. There are just files, created by the ARMA III GUI Editor. You may load them if you want to change a dialog.
See documentation of GUI Editor for more information.

--- Bugs/Incomplete Features ---

To implement by yourself:
* Admin menu (Incomplete)
* Wanted 'Add' function (not working properly)
* More houses (Learn from existing houses how to do it - technically it's not difficult)
* More

--- May I change file/picture/... xy? ---

YES! It's the same license, Tonic used for his mod - you may change everything, add everything you want, ...
BUT: Usually, you have to do everything yourself - We won't setup your server.

--- I want feature xy. Can you add it? ---

You may add it yourself.

--- Sniper license for cops ---

A cop only can buy a sniper weapon if he has sniper license. You can only give this license by changing database entry.
But you may implement an easier to use system, using PERMS - we didn't do this, because PERMS is a very new feature.
